Forgot password functionality
  * Setup Parse.com cloud functions environment
  * Create dummy function to return "Ok, email was sent" or "Error, no such email address, please double check"
  * Post that function online and bind with user interface

  * During sign up - check if there is such email already, if there is such email, then show error
    and disable create button

  * Write functionality to be triggered by User Sign Up button

=====Use cases==========
  Forgot Password Successful (Valid email)
    1) User enters his email in 'enter your email' input box
    2) User clicks 'Restore Password' button
    3) 'Password reset was sent to your email'

User successfully Logs in - Group List Screen:
1) User sees a table listing all of the groups they have access too
2) User can select a group they wish to access
V 3) User can click button to create new group

Group Menu Screen - See screenshot I sent (Screenshot_2014-04-24)
1)User email is displayed on the top right
2)Group Name is top centered
3)User clicks Logout Group to go back to the Group List Screen
4)User clicks Edit Group to view group details - lightbox view may be good here
5)Buttons for Classes related to the group appear on the left column on the screen - EQUIPMENT, Inventory.
When a button is clicked, the center portion of the screen displays a table of objects within the class that is related to the Group.
6)User can add a new object or view/edit existing object - use pop out lightbox for this.
7)In the right column, display a table of ACTIVITY class that lists all recent activity for the group.

Keep up the great work and i look forward to seeing some more progress. Also, please push out latest changes. I have many other projects i am looking to hire developers for so as long as we continue making progress in a reasonable timeframe, i will definitely want to consider you for these projects.


Define router with separate url for each view with id

Parse.com custom backend logic

* Add file uploading and saving file functionality:
    var fileUploadControl = $("#profilePhotoFileUpload")[0];
    if (fileUploadControl.files.length > 0) {
      var file = fileUploadControl.files[0];
      var name = "photo.jpg";

      var parseFile = new Parse.File(name, file);
    }
