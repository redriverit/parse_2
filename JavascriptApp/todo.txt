I am most concerned with just getting this all connected and the layout for the app. I am very knowledgeable to creating the appropriate queries and once i see a few examples, i can assist with this process. I don't want to spend too much time on the little details, just get the general functionality working. I will be using this app as a template for several projects, so the class names/attributes will change as projects change.

Keep up the great work and i look forward to seeing some more progress. Also, please push out latest changes. I have many other projects i am looking to hire developers for so as long as we continue making progress in a reasonable timeframe, i will definitely want to consider you for these projects.
